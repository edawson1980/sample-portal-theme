# sample-portal-theme
custom WP theme utilizing custom-built Client Portal via ACF and Custom Post Types.


Building off a work-in-progress sample WP theme.  The client will be able to access their individual dashboard which shows modules for each of the project deliverables (content, design, timeline, etc).  From the dashboard the client can navigate into an individual module and leave feedback.  This functionality also serves as a Quality Control measure because the client has to acknowledge which round of revisions they are on.

Built using the ACF plugin.
